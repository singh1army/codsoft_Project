Iris Dataset Analysis Project
Project Overview: The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the field of machine learning, often used for benchmarking algorithms and demonstrating data analysis techniques.
This project involves an in-depth analysis and visualization of the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three species of Iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

Objectives:

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data and relationships between features.
Visualize the dataset using various plotting techniques to reveal patterns and correlations.
Implement machine learning algorithms to classify the Iris species based on the given features.
Evaluate the performance of the classification models using appropriate metrics.
Tools and Techniques:

Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
EDA: Statistical summary, pair plots, histograms, and box plots.
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Results: The project successfully demonstrates how different machine learning algorithms can be applied to classify Iris species with high accuracy, providing insights into the distinguishing features of each species. The visualizations and analysis offer a clear understanding of the data and its applications in predictive modeling.
